# southeastern_shrooms
Work-in-progress; a practice website containing info about fungi native to the American Southeast.

Update: I believe I need to learn a framework like React or Angular before I can efficiently complete the pages with details for each species (unless I want to eventually fill put hundreds of html files for each unique species).  This project will remain mostly untouched until I can do so, at which point I'll continue.
