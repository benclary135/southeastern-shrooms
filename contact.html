                <strong>About Ben Clary:</strong><br>I live in Southeast Tennessee near Chattanooga, and have been studying and collecting mushrooms for a few years now.  What started as my "pandemic hobby" after being laid off in the spring of 2020 has become a lifelong interest in the beauty, complexity, and usefulness of fungi.  As a way to practice a new hobby of mine (web development), I made this website as a resource specifically for those foraging in the Southeast, as I feel there are not many resources that cater specifically to amateur mycologists in this area.  I love talking to others about this topic, so if you have any questions, comments about this website or its contents, or just feel like saying hi, feel free to use the form below!  I look forward to hearing from you.
